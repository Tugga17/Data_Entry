[Updates to app]
\make new file that connects to keep code clean and seprate 

-add a button to transform source files after transformation is complete 

\the button is because not eveyrone will need to transform source files
so the people wo are uploading to perfman will have the option to 

-The button would trnasform the source files to match perfman file and then add the data to a master sheet\
\when data is added it needs to be added to the same exact tab whihc will be named PerfMan_Data
put a new line after every entry. The file can be overwritten everytime this process happens. 

-upload custom file to perfmna logic can stay the same. The plan is to make the master sheet so u dont have to
upload mutiple perfman dude files one at a time, but instead upload a master sheet. 

-Add trnasformation to match the perfamn side
