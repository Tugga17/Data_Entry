Incentive Automation tool
Before using the tool ensure that the spreadsheets you will be transferring data from are closed.
Make sure the tool is locally on your computer. (Like on your desktop or downloads etc)
Putting the app in a folder is recommended so that the save transfers and presets Json’s are in the same place
It is also recommended to enable trusted documents on automate spreadsheets to quicken the process and limit human interaction
•	Source, Destination, and Sheet
The source will be the excel file you are transferring data from. By clicking source you will be able to open file explorer and select your file. Destination is the file data is being put into. It can be selected the same as source. The Sheet is the name of sheet. Sheet must be manually typed in and the sheet you are transferring data to and from need to share the same name.
•	Save Transfer/Load Transfer
Save transfer allows you to save the transfer you are currently on. Load transfer allows you to quickly load in the transfer you’ve made. Beware that saving another transfer will overwrite the transfer you have previously saved.
•	Load From Saved Presets/Save New Preset
Save new preset allows you to permanently save a set of transfers, name them, and load them later. They will be saved as an editable json to a preset folder wherever your tool is located. This is great for transfers that happen on a consistent basis and contains a lot.
•	Enable Month Filtering 
Allows to filter data by month. You must click the box next to the check mark to enable or disable month filtering. If you enable it and select a month and then disable it, the month you selected will still appear in the box. This does NOT mean that it is still filtering by month, it will only do that if the box next to the check mark is checked off. If month filtering is enabled it will copy everything over to the spread sheet Except the months after what was selected. When you select a month it will give you the data from January to that month. January is the baseline of the enable month filtering feature. 
•	Add Another Transfer/Remove
Add transfer allows you to add another transfer, and remove transfer allows you to remove a transfer.
•	Run All Transfers
Preforms the transfers.
