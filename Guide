• Select Transform Files

This allows you to manually select one or more files to transform into Perfman’s expected format. When selected, you can open File Explorer and pick the Excel file(s) you want. These files will be used to extract and organize data into a format that Perfman understands. This is helpful if you aren’t using the built-in transfer logic but still want to prepare files for upload.

• Transform for Perfman

This button automatically transforms any files you’ve transferred using the tool. It takes the data from the Destination files of all successful transfers and reformats it to match the layout Perfman needs. The transformed data is saved to a master sheet that is generated automatically. Each time you run the transform, the sheet is overwritten with the latest results. You do not need to select any files manually for this — the tool handles everything based on the transfers you just ran.

• Transform Destination File

If you prefer to select a single file (instead of running a full transfer first), this lets you manually choose a destination file and transform it on its own. This is useful for cases where you’ve already copied over data or are only transforming a partial dataset. Like with other transforms, the output is appended to the master file for Perfman upload.

• Upload Custom File to Perfman

After transforming your files, this button sends the data from the master sheet directly into Perfman. You don’t need to select anything — the tool automatically pulls from the latest version of the Perfman master sheet. Once clicked, the tool will take care of the upload and notify you when it’s done. A spinning loader will appear at the bottom of the window while the upload is in progress.
